The cost per treatment area ends up being similar."},{"q":"How is Daxxify different from Botox or Jeuveau?","a":"Daxxify works the same way but is formulated to last longer — in some patients, results last 6 weeks longer compared to the typical 3–4 months for Botox or Jeuveau."},{"q":"Which should I choose: Daxxify or Jeuveau or Botox?","a":"We love all! If you prefer fewer appointments and potentially longer-lasting results, Daxxify may be your choice. Botox and Jeuveau are great if you like the flexibility to adjust your look more often."},{"q":"Will I look frozen?","a":"No—our approach preserves natural movement while softening lines."},{"q":"When do I see results?","a":"You’ll start to notice changes in 1-2 days, with full results in about 2 weeks. One of the benefits of Daxxify is the fast onset!"},{"q":"How long does it last?","a":"Daxxify was designed as a long-lasting tox, so typically patients see 6+ weeks longer results than other tox options."},{"q":"Does it hurt?","a":"Quick pinches; most rate it 2-3/10."},{"q":"Can I switch from another brand?","a":"Yes—many switch easily based on onset and feel."},{"q":"Is there any downtime?","a":"No major downtime — you can return to normal activities right after, but avoid exercise for 24 hours and lying flat or rubbing the area for 4 hours."},{"q":"How much does it cost? How many units will I need?","a":"Daxxify is priced per unit. As a general rule of thumb, you will need 2x your typical Botox or Jeauveau dose (and the price reflect this). At RELUXE, we offer Daxxify at $7/unit and membership pricing for $5/unit for predictable costs."},{"q":"Why membership pricing?","a":"Because it gives you the best results and the best value. We believe the right dose lasts longer, loyal clients deserve our best Daxxify pricing, and pairing treatments with pro skincare delivers the most youthful, healthy skin — so our members save on every service, every product, every time."},{"q":"Can I pair Daxxify with other treatments?","a":"Absolutely — it pairs beautifully with dermal fillers, facials, and laser treatments for a more complete rejuvenation. Order is important, so our team can help ensure you get the best result!"},{"q":"Is Daxxify a filler?","a":"No — Filler that adds volume under the skin, while Daxxify is a neurotoxin that reduces muscle movement to smooth wrinkles. They treat different concerns."}],"variants":{"hero":"classic","quickFacts":"pills","benefits":"classic","beforeAfter":"compare","howItWorks":"steps","candidates":"badges","process":"checklist","pricing":"tiers","comparison":"cards","video":"cine","faq":"top5","providers":"cards","related":"scroll","prepAftercare":"cards","flexEverything":"tips"},"blockPriorities":{"hero":10,"quickFacts":20,"benefits":30,"beforeAfter":35,"howItWorks":45,"candidates":55,"process":65,"pricing":70,"comparison":75,"faq":85,"testimonials":95,"providerSpotlight":110,"relatedServices":120,"flexEverything":130,"prepAftercare":140,"lasers":999,"bookingEmbed":150},"comparison":{"columns":["Daxxify","Jeuveau®","Botox®","Dysport®"],"rows":[{"label":"Onset","options":[{"value":"~2d"},{"value":"2–4d"},{"value":"3–7d"},{"value":"2–4d"}]},{"label":"Duration","options":[{"value":"6 weeks longer"},{"value":"3–4mo"},{"value":"3–4mo"},{"value":"3–4mo"}]},{"label":"Feel","options":[{"value":"Silky"},{"value":"Silky"},{"value":"Classic"},{"value":"Feathered"}]}]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
