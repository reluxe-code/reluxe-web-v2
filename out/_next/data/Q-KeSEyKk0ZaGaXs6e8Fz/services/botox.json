Most people describe it as a few small pinches, and then they’re back to work, errands, or the gym.","p2":"At RELUXE, your visit starts with a friendly, honest consult. We map your unique expressions, discuss goals and budget, and create a plan that keeps your features natural and balanced. You’ll leave with simple aftercare tips and a clear timeline for touch-ups (typically every 3–4 months, depending on your muscles and metabolism)."},"whyReluxe":[{"title":"Expert injectors & providers","body":"Care by an anatomy-focused Nurse Practitioner and trained injectors who customize dosing for your face, lifestyle, and goals."},{"title":"Personalized dosing & plans","body":"We map movement/skin and tailor treatment for results that actually last."},{"title":"Membership value","body":"Best pricing on Botox & all complementary services for results you can maintain."},{"title":"The RELUXE experience","body":"Easy booking, zero-pressure consults, and real follow-up care."}],"tagline":"Refresh your look—keep your expression.","bookingLink":"/book/botox","quickFacts":[{"iconKey":"clock","label":"Duration","value":"30 min"},{"iconKey":"fire","label":"Downtime","value":"None–Minimal"},{"iconKey":"sparkles","label":"Onset","value":"14 days"},{"iconKey":"user","label":"Lasts","value":"3–4 months"}],"benefits":["Softens expression lines","Prevents new wrinkles","Quick, no downtime","Natural-looking results","Our most popular treatment"],"howItWorks":[{"title":"Consult & Map","body":"We assess movement, anatomy, and goals."},{"title":"Perfect Dosing","body":"Targeted dosing for balanced results."},{"title":"Review & Plan","body":"Follow-up for refinement if needed."}],"candidates":{"good":["Forehead lines","Glabellar (11s)","Crow’s feet","Bunny lines","Lip flip"],"notIdeal":["Active infection at site","Pregnant or nursing","Neuromuscular disorders—consult first"]},"appointmentSteps":["Arrive makeup-free or we’ll cleanse.","Photos for tracking (optional).","Treatment: 10–20 tiny pinches.","Back to life—avoid workouts 24 hrs."],"pricing":{"single":"$14/unit","packages":[{"label":"Member Unit Price","value":"$10/unit"}]},"flexEverything":{"intro":"Small, precise doses customized to your muscle pattern.","items":[{"heading":"Get the right dose","body":"Everyone is different & our expert nurse injectors will help you get the perfect dose."},{"heading":"Follow-up at 2 weeks","body":"Optional fine-tuning to perfect symmetry."},{"heading":"Maintenance cadence","body":"Plan 3–4 months; longer for Daxxify."},{"heading":"Pairing tips","body":"Lip flip, masseter slimming, skin resurfacing or facial balancing."}]},"prepAftercare":{"prep":{"title":"Before your visit","points":["Arrive with clean skin","Avoid alcohol 24 hrs prior","Pause retinoids 48 hrs prior"]},"after":{"title":"After your visit","points":["SPF daily","Avoid intense heat 24 hrs","Follow your custom care sheet"]}},"faq":[{"q":"What is Botox?","a":"Botox is an FDA-approved injectable that relaxes targeted muscles to smooth wrinkles and prevent new ones from forming."},{"q":"Will I look frozen?","a":"No—our approach preserves natural movement while softening lines."},{"q":"When do I see results?","a":"You’ll start to notice changes in 3–5 days, with full results in about 2 weeks"},{"q":"How long does it last?","a":"Typically 3+ months, but it can vary for each person."},{"q":"Does it hurt?","a":"Quick pinches; most rate it 2–3/10."},{"q":"Is there any downtime?","a":"No major downtime — you can return to normal activities right after, but avoid exercise for 24 hours and lying flat or rubbing the area for 4 hours."},{"q":"How much does it cost?
