Dysport, Jeuveau, and Daxxify are all FDA-approved neuromodulators (commonly called \u201ctox\u201d) that work by temporarily relaxing the muscles that cause wrinkles. The difference? How fast they kick in, how far they spread, and how long they last.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) has been FDA-approved since 2002 and is the most well-known brand. It\u2019s precise, predictable, and works beautifully for targeted areas like crow\u2019s feet, forehead lines, and the \u201c11s\u201d between your brows. Onset is typically 3\u20135 days, with full results at 2 weeks. Duration: 3\u20134 months for most patients.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'Dysport: The Fast Starter' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Dysport (abobotulinumtoxinA) tends to kick in faster \u2014 many patients notice softening within 24\u201348 hours. It also spreads a bit more than Botox, which makes it a great choice for larger areas like the forehead. The trade-off: it may not last quite as long for some patients. Duration: 3\u20134 months.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'Jeuveau: The Newcomer' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Jeuveau (prabotulinumtoxinA) is the newest tox on the market, specifically designed for aesthetics (not medical use). It\u2019s priced competitively and performs similarly to Botox in clinical trials. If you\u2019re looking for an effective, affordable option, Jeuveau is worth discussing with your provider. Duration: 3\u20134 months.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'Daxxify: The Long-Laster' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Daxxify (daxibotulinumtoxinA) is a game-changer for duration. In clinical trials, it lasted 6\u20139 months for many patients \u2014 roughly twice as long as traditional tox. It uses a novel peptide technology instead of human albumin. The catch: it\u2019s typically priced higher per session, but you may need fewer appointments per year.' },

First-time patients often start with Botox or Dysport, then explore Daxxify once they know how they respond. The most important factor isn\u2019t the brand \u2014 it\u2019s the injector.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Most fillers contain lidocaine (numbing agent), and your provider will apply topical numbing cream 15\u201320 minutes before injecting. The actual injection process takes 10\u201330 minutes depending on the area. You\u2019ll feel pressure and a slight pinch, but it\u2019s very manageable. Lips tend to be the most sensitive area.' },

      { type: 'h2', text: 'How It Works' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Morpheus8 delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy through tiny microneedles that penetrate up to 4mm into the skin. This heats the deeper tissue layers, triggering your body\u2019s natural collagen and elastin production. The result: tighter, smoother, more even skin that improves over 3\u20136 months as new collagen forms.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'What It Treats' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Morpheus8 is incredibly versatile. On the face, it addresses fine lines, wrinkles, acne scarring, enlarged pores, uneven texture, mild jowling, and overall laxity. On the body, it works on stretch marks, cellulite dimpling, skin laxity (especially post-weight-loss), and crepey texture on areas like the neck, chest, and arms.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Most patients see significant improvement after 1\u20133 sessions spaced 4\u20136 weeks apart. Mild concerns (texture, pores) may only need 1 session. Moderate scarring or laxity typically requires 3 sessions for optimal results. Maintenance treatments once or twice a year keep results going.' },
